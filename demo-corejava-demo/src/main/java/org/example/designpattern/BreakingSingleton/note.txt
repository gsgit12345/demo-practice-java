We can break three ways singleton

1-Reflection:-To overcome the breaking singleton  using reflection,we can use enum.java gurantee itself
that enum value is instantitate only once.Singleton using Enums are only drawback is it does not allow lazy initialization.you can not invoke enum constructor.
java invoke the enum constructor.
2-serialization:-To overcome this issue, we have to implement the method readResolve() method.
3-Cloning

Overcome Cloning issue: To overcome this issue, override clone() method and throw an exception from clone method that is CloneNotSupportedException.
 Now, whenever user will try to create clone of singleton object, it will throw an exception and hence our class remains singleton.
