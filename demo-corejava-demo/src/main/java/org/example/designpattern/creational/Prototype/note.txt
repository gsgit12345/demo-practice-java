It is used when we have to make copy/clone from the existing object.It is copy the existing object rather than create new object.
the existing object acts as prototype and contains the state of the object.using two mechanism ,you can create the clone of the object.
interface -> The cloning techniques are declared in the interface. Itâ€™s usually only a single clone method.
Concrete Class -> The cloning method is implemented by the Concrete Prototype class.
Client Class -> The client class will use the Interface to create/get the copy of Concrete class.
1-Deep copy:-in deep copy , original and cloned object would be different.if we changed any property of the cloned object.it would not be visible in the original object.
2-Shallow copy:-in shallow copy if class has any reference object and if you change any property of cloned ,it would be visible in the original object.

Use case:-suppose we are loading data from the database and try to manipulate with data and saving again data in database.In this case we will
