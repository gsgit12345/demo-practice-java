Advantage and use cases
1-it controls the concurrent access  to the resource.
2-it ensures that there is only one object available across the application in a controlled state.
3-it is used in logging ,driver object ,caching and thread pool.
4-it is also used in other design pattern like abstract factory,builder,prototype,facad etc.

Implementation

1-Private constructor so that we can not instantiate from other classes.
2-private static variable of the same classes that is the only instance of the class.
3-public static method that returns the instance of the class.this is the global access point for the outer world to get the instance of the singleton class

Disadvantage of the EagerSingleton:-The disadvantage of EagerSingleton is object is created at the time of class loading.while client is not using the object.
Disadvantage of the LazySingleton:-The disadvantage of the LazySingleton is that it is not safe in multithreaded environment.
